KRYX II â€” Kryx Origin

"You're not matching."

"Do we need to be?"

"I'm not sure." Kira thought a moment. "It'll be fine."

Then they left out the door of their home in Staros City and made their way to the Crimson Ball.

An hour in a city car later they arrived at a very tall building.

People littered the entry way as they ventured out to the stairs leading in.

Kira wore a rose red dress and Kryx wore an all black suit.

One of the girls lining the entry held a rose and as they past Kira ran a few steps and asked her, "would you mind?"

The girl proceeded to give her the rose and on her way back to Kryx she broke it in half.

"Here." She pinned it through his suit pocket and it stuck. "At least it's something."

Then the couple made their way inside.

"Darling you must hear this." Remarked the woman in a black and white dress. "Tell us again about the Restos hunters."

"They are fierce," Kryx began, then he was quickly interrupted by gunfire.

Everyone looked in the direction of the sound.

"This here, ladies and gentlemen, is a handgun." The important man spoke out. "Watch closely." He said, and then he pointed it at Kryx and shot.

It bounced off his chest.

"I knew it." Cried the man. He shot again. Again it bounced off Kryx and hit the floor.

Kryx took a step forward. "What of this?" He asked curiously.

The man recoiled and laughed nervously. "Restos won't be safe for long." He muttered and he left the ballroom to the confused guests.

"I'm bringing a magic wand next year." Kryx remarked loudly. Everyone laughed and the party continued on into the night.

Only the important man with the handgun knew this was the last night they'd spend in Staros peacefully.

For tomorrow, war began.
