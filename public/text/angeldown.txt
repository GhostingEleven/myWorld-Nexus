Angeldown I

On a dark night, in a quiet port, on a small trade planet, two lovers were about to embark on an epic journey across the galaxy in one of the most advanced single pilot spaceships in the whole universe. The Angeldown.

"That's the last one. We're good to go." Said Ryder.

"There's no way you can make it past the belt this early. Wait until after the moon."

He looked back at his ship. "She'll handle it. Take the gold and forget you ever saw me."

"You sure?" The port crewman looked at Ryder then back towards the encampment, "A warm meal over a wild gunning belt that will tear you and your ship apart. Come on, you'd have to be crazy."

Ryder smiled and patted the man on the shoulder.

"She'll handle the belt. This is an XDC Angeldown Wingbird. She'll handle a death storm tsunami."

The man turned angry. He pressed his tongue to his lower lip and looked at Ryder. "I said come inside." He drew a sidearm pistol.

Ryder immediately raised his arms. "Hey man, we had a deal. You are getting paid well for this."

The man glanced at the cargo in the ships bay. "True, but see, I looked in those crates."

They locked eyes and with his hands still raised Ryder took half a step backwards. 

"Look man. What's your plan? There's no need to point that thing my way. There's a new deal to be made every day."

"How about I just kill you and take the millennium gold, the ship, and that shiny trinket that glows like Saturn six."

Ryder put his arms out helplessly towards the man. "That trinket is princess Aleria's sacred crown. You'll be dead in a week." He took a step closer as if to reason.

"Princess Aleria? Asked the man. "Never heard of her."

"I doubt she wants you to." Ryder replied.

He looked over the man's shoulder as if someone was coming and he reacted, glancing behind him. It was enough to allow Ryder to rush forward and bridge the small gap between them as the gun let off a single shot into the ground.

They struggled and soon Ryder had the man's weapon aimed at him. He backed away towards the Angeldown. When he reached the ramp of the ship he yelled out to Aleria.

"Start the engines!" 

The Angeldown started to hum as Ryder boarded the ship. He held eyes with the man on the dock, then fired a shot at the ground by his feet. The crewman jumped away to avoid it. Ryder smiled as the ship's ramp closed, ending the interaction. 

He approached Aleria flying the ship.

"He wanted your crown." He offered.

Aleria smiled, "Doesn't everyone?"

He took his seat and they left the trade port of Adlencia, travelling through the vastness of space. They were on their way to Saros, with a few stops on the way. But what they didn't know, is they weren't the only ones.

Angeldown II

"We're straight in and out okay. Meet Lexy, exchange the gold for the Archetype Stones and get back here asap. The last thing we need is to be spotted in this sector. It's the red door, building 16. Remember Aleria, Lexy doesn't like your kind. Don't mention Artoros and don't mention the war. Just do the swap and get out. We meet back here."

Aleria nodded. "What are you going to do?"

"We need supplies and a wing rip accelerator for the XDC. Tyrius, an old friend of mine from the Sanctuary lives here. He can help."

"Isn't the sanctuary where they did all those experiments?"

Ryder ignored her question.

"He shouldn't be hard to find. Meet back here before dusk, or run protocol K."

Aleria acknowledged his orders and the two spread off through the crowd and down the busy streets of Lower Town, Midearth. Each on their mission, with one ultimate goal in mind. 

To return to Arkos.

Angeldown III

Ryder looked around the alleyway then knocked heavily on the door. After a brief moment it opened a few inches to reveal a set of eyes. They looked at Ryder and the familiarity hit Tyrius. He smiled widely, "Well if it isn't the ghost of the black halls of Dakus. Come in my friend." Tyrius unprimed his weapon and Ryder heard it click back to safety.

"You in trouble again?" He asked.

Tyrius poked his head out and looked both ways down the alley then at Ryder. "Nope." Pulling the door open he motioned him inside. "Come on. I've got fresh sake and steak from the badlands. You're just in time."

Both men entered the main living quarters from the entry hallway. It was littered with electronics and tech. Mechanics from prosthetics to spacecraft parts lay piled along a large room-long bench. The place didn't look like it had much room to live in, but there was a small kitchen and a somewhat cozy lounge space, with a large cramped couch facing three large screens. There was a desk pushed up against the back of the room with papers and plans pinned to the wall above it.

"So this is your place huh? I like it."

"Shut up." Said Tyrius clearly annoyed, "Has Grace resurfaced?" He asked.

Ryder shook his head, "She's off system. And with a payoff like that she isn't coming back." 

"I could be at the plaza sipping Suki Supreme's right now if she didn't betray us."

"There was no time. If she waited we were all dead. We were lucky to make it out."

"If I ever see her again..." Tyrius began but Ryder interrupted.

"Steak?" He questioned.

Tyrius stopped and smiled. "Of course my friend. Come."

They made their way to the small kitchen in the corner and Tyrius pulled out two steaks and a bottle of Sake.

"You know it's not that bad here. Most people keep to themselves, the bars sell cheap, and I got a connect for everything. All things considered, I'm doing alright."

Ryder nodded, "speaking of connects I need a wing rip accelerater for my XDC Angeldown."

"What the haze?" Tyrius slammed the steaks down on the bench and opened the bottle. "Last time I saw you was in the greenroom chasing a lift to the Astroid moons. Now somehow you're telling me you have an Angeldown?" He looked around his apartment then back at Ryder, "God hates me." He took a large drink of Sake.

Ryder smiled, "Maybe you just need another chance." 

Tyrius raised his eyebrows then shrugged, "I know that look, but before any more quote unquote opportunities, let's eat and drink."

"Of course old friend." Ryder took the bottle from Tyrius and poured two glasses as Tyrius began to cook the meat.

"You been here since 11? Since the job?"

"Pretty much. I had a hook in with the gate guys. Got me into this place with a nice setup at the workshop. Just been waiting for word ever since. So what's the word Ryder?"

Ryder took a moment then offered, "Grace is history. If she one day shows up, it's a good day for us. Other than that, I passed a lone Cruiser, tailgated his destination. Los. There's a ship in it for you if you want it?"

"A Cruiser hey? Well, it's not an Angeldown but good thrust. What's the plan?"

"I don't have one yet. Don't know what we're looking at. Probably a blindside, depends who they are and what Los is like. There's a bigger plan."

"Who's the girl?" Asked Tyrius.

Ryder scratched the back of his neck. "Ah, she's actually a princess."

Tyrius laughed. "Of what?"

"Arkos."

Tyrius again smiled widely. "Is that a place in her head?"

"No Tyrius. It's not in her head." He paused, "I don't think." He shook his head slightly and smiled "Pretty sure it's real. It's not a short trip though. Outer edges and beyond. This is not for the faint of heart and this is going to take some time, but there's a whole world we haven't seen. And I hear it's pretty good. You can come if you want. Or we can part ways in Los once you get that cruiser and you do one more thing for me. Deal?"

Tyrius thought it over but not for long. "It'd be an honor to hit space with you on another adventure mate. Count me in."

"What about the wing rip accelerator?"

Tyrius took the pan off the stove and dug his hunting knife into the first piece of steak and took a bite. Then he passed Ryder and made his way to the long steel bench. He picked up a metallic cube the size of his hand and held it up. "Got it." He smiled. 

"Let's go to Los."

Angeldown IV

Aleria felt uncomfortable as she walked through the busy crowd towards building sixteen in Midearth City. She hadn't mentioned it to Ryder but she didn't feel safe without his broad shoulders, quick wit and gun-slinging prowess backing her every move. She bumped into a young man rushing down the main drag and she stepped back checking all her pockets. He hadn't taken anything and she continued walking. 

She knocked on the blood red door of building sixteen and after thirty seconds a sliding latch revealed a pair of eyes. They looked her up and down and then in a deep blistering voice he asked, "who are you and what do you want?"

As Aleria went to answer the door flung open. "Come inside. Lexy is waiting."

She entered the building and cautiously followed the large man down a flight of stairs into what seemed like a basement. The bottom of the staircase opened up to reveal a large dimly lit room. Aleria realized it was an opium den. People and aliens filled each section, smoking or sitting or wandering around in a daze, and Aleria immediately felt uneasy. The man led her past the patrons and through a door at the back of the den. It led to a beautiful office with expensive paintings and a large bookshelf masking the walls. Lexy sat at her desk at the end of the room. She was very beautiful, with dark black hair and great white wings that extended out from her back. One side was edged in gold markings Aleria couldn't make out.

"Um, hi. I'm Aleria." She offered.

Lexy looked at her. "Come forward and arch a path of prosperity with each step. I'm among you, but left a gaze to fade, so be wary. Let me see." She ushered her forward.

Aleria obliged and revealed her satchel filled with millennium gold. "Hello Lexy, it's nice to meet you. I've brought what you asked", said Aleria offering a formal smile.

"They always say too much." Said Lexy to the large man at her side.

Aleria didn't quite understand but she felt she had insulted her. "Um, I'm sorry. I mean no offense."

"It's fine." Said Lexy. "Hand it over." 

Aleria did as she asked and handed her 2.7 million in millennium gold. Lexy took it and examined the goods before handing it to the large man by her side. She slowly turned back to Aleria. "You're royalty." She said.

Aleria felt tremendous fear run through her. "Ah, no Ms Honeycomb. You must be mistaken. I'm but here for the stones. My husband has a buyer in Los. I'm from the belts out near the Waters, the quarries."

Lexy examined her up and down, her judgement piercing Aleria's skin. She felt danger and thought back to her days on Arkos. She was well trained but had never seen a moment of true combat.

Lexy smiled at her two men then took her sights back to Aleria.

"It's okay dear. I may look dangerous, but I got these wings for a reason, and these two..." She motioned towards the men. "Daz here is a bowling enthusiast and Jeremy has season tickets to the floating opera. We are not the ones that should concern you."

Aleria felt some relief and responded, "I like the opera too."

"Of course you do. You are royalty." Said Lexy as she stood from her chair. She leaned forward, "You are from Arkos are you not?"

"I assure you Lexy I have no royal blood."

Lexy slammed her fist down on the table, "You are princess Aleria of the Arkos royal family. The daughter of Oma and Medina. You are second in line to the throne after your older sister Kala. Tell me this is not true." She looked Aleria right in the eye.

She dropped her head, "How do you know about Arkos and my family?" She asked.

Lexy offered a forced smile. "The fact it's so far away does not mean much for me. I know Arkos well." She looked down at her dark wooden desk, then rose her eyes back up. "Arkos took my love."

Aleria felt fear rush through her again. "I do not wish trouble Lexy. I'm here on behalf of Ryder to trade for the stones. Please, do not judge me by my family. He said I could trust you."

"Ryder." Lexy responded. "For some reason the thought to Ryder tethering up with a princess of a place he knows nothing of, somehow isn't even a ponder. How you haven't seen through him however, that's the begging question."

"I just came for the stones." Said Aleria. I haven't seen Arkos or my family in years. Whatever they did to you I swear I am not involved."

Lexy stood a moment. Both her henchmen looked angry but she did not. After a moment she approached Aleria with a small chest from the drawer of her desk. She offered out her hand and Aleria reluctantly took it. Then looking her deep in the eyes Lexy spoke.

"Aleria, I've among to many places in this galaxy. Places you couldn't even imagine. Yet it's true I found Arkos to be one of the most beautiful. It is no surprise to see such sparkling green eyes and beautiful long blonde hair in the lovely face of their princess. Even if it is covered up by all your royal hidings."

She intimately caressed her hand then rose it up to her cheek. Aleria stood there motionless. She considered grabbing the stones and making a run for it, but she knew it would be fruitless, and she would need to get past the man between her and the door. Admiring Aleria's face Lexy smiled, "If your people all look like you no wonder he stayed." She spoke softly to herself. Aleria just stood there nervously. 

"My dear," Lexy offered after a moment, "I am not going to hurt you. The opposite in fact. I'm going to help you in an attempt to help myself."

Aleria felt relief. "Of course. I'll help in any way I can."

She handed her the chest of stones.

"I assume you plan on returning to Arkos?" Lexy asked. "Hence your need for these." 

Aleria could not hide her feelings, "Yes. I plan on going home."

"Then I need you to do something for me. I need you to find someone there and deliver them a message for me. Can you do that?"

Aleria's eyes lifted, "Yes. Certainly." She replied. "How will I find him?"

Lexy smiled and brought her right edged wing forward. "His name is Stak. He has wings like me. The same markings too. I need you to find him and tell him I'm still alive. Can you do that for me?"

Aleria felt relief, "Yes Lexy. It's the least I can do for your friendship."

"Good girl. There's one more thing you need to know before you leave here." She leaned in close and whispered, "There's people looking for you." She turned still holding Aleria's hand, "Follow me." She said as she pressed a button on her wrist and the wall behind her opened to reveal a hidden walkway.

Aleria followed her through a brightly lit hallway until they reached an elevator. Lexy stopped at it. "One day maybe if you live long enough I'll show you what's behind this magic door." She smiled with reflective whimsy. "I think I like you Aleria." Then she pointed to the door at the other end of the hall. "Head out that way. It leads straight back to Midearth port. Get back to your ship and off this planet as fast as you can. Good luck."

Aleria nodded with confidence. "Thank you Lexy." Then she disappeared out the door and began her way back to Ryder and the ship.

Angeldown V

Ryder approached the Angeldown with Tyrius. He unlocked it with his wrist mech and soon the ramp was down. He thought Aleria might be there but it was empty. "She should be back by now." He said worried. 

"Who me? Said Aleria, marching up the ramp with the stones behind him.

He turned to see the chest of Archetype Stones and Aleria in one piece.

"How was Lexy?" He asked.

"Scary." Replied Aleria, "She knew who I was."

"That's not great news but I trust Lexy. It's nothing to worry about."

"You know what is though..." Aleria began.

"Ah-hum, excuse me Madame. My name is Tyrium." He bowed his head to Aleria. "Ryder is terrible at introductions."

"Oh, hi. I'm Aleria." She offered back.

Ryder took a step back between them, "Aleria, this is my friend Tyrium. He is going to come with us to Los."

Aleria offered her hand to him. "Nice to meet you Tyrium and welcome to our little outfit."

"Is this your Angeldown?" He asked her.

She laughed, "No, it's actually his."

Tyrium scratched his head, "Really?"

"Shut up Tyrium." Said Ryder. "Let's get out of here."

"You get the wing accelerator?" She asked.

Tyrium held it up. "I'll get it in. Only take ten minutes." Looking around the hull he could be heard murmuring to himself, "But it's so big."

Ryder and Aleria sat in the cockpit and started the engines.

"To Los." 

Ryder looked at Aleria.

"To Los."

Angeldown VI

"You have just entered Los airspace. Please identify yourself and your business, and have all signatures available upon request."

Ryder slowed the ship slightly and turned to Aleria, "You sure you know what you're doing here?" He asked.

"I can trust her. Trust me." She replied.

Ryder breathed in a deep breath. "Okay."

He grabbed the radio, "This is Roger Newman from The Peninsula. Me and my crew have business with the Martha Group."

There was a long silence then a voice responded. "Signatures?"

"In person. On request."

"That's highly unusual."

Ryder did not reply.

"Let me check the name."

They waited, with Ryder quick on the draw to turn and run at a moments notice. But after a long silence the voice came back, "Access granted. Lane 17." 

They looked at each other and kissed.

"We're in."

Angeldown VII

Ryder slowed the engine to a halt. He undid his vest and stood up as Aleria started towards the bags on the side of the main section of the ship. She found the bag with what she needed. The chest of stones were locked in the cockpit safe. The ship was the safest place for them. There was a deadlock attached to both Ryder and Aleria.  The Angeldown was nothing but dead weight to anyone else.

Tyrium lay sleeping in the main cabin and Aleria quickly woke him up. "We're here."

He jumped out of his bed and began throwing on his jacket. Taking a swig of sake and calfing his hunting knife he was out the door.

Ryder met the other two at the rear of the ship and with one last look at each other the ramp door lowered. 

They were in a large hanger on the outskirts of Los. It was desert all around yet the buildings rose to the skies. The largest of all being the Martha Group building.

"Will she even see us?" Asked Tyrius looking up at the huge high rise.

"Yes. I am a princess." Replied Aleria.

She brought the hood of her cloak over her head and began walking out into the desert heat. Ryder and Tyrius followed.

Angeldown VIII

"I cannot believe you are here." Martha said softly to Aleria. "Come here girl. Let me see you."

Aleria smiled the brightest smile.

"My love. I've missed you."

"You got some meat on your bones." She admired Aleria up and down. "You grew up." She offered smiling. "How about me?" She asked with whimsy taking a step back to parade herself to Aleria.

Aleria stepped forward and hugged her tightly. "You look as beautiful as ever. And my gosh, look at this place."

Martha smiled, "You ain't seen nothing yet."

Aleria turned to Ryder and Tyrius. Tyrius was fixing his hair. "Martha, these are my friends Ryder and Tyrius."

Ryder bowed and when Tyrius saw he also bowed.

"Come." Said Martha. "Let me show you everything."

Ryder suddenly felt very uneasy but said nothing as the four of them entered the building as a host of Martha Group employees looked on.

Tyrius ended up asking the question they all wanted to ask. "Excuse me Martha, but what do you do here?" He asked. "This is one giant building."

She kept walking through the foyer to the elevators and looking back answered, "Mainly we manage the flow of industry trade wears and engineering for long flight space logistics..." She said with a smile. "And of course, anything else I want." She winked at Aleria forcing a smile. "What about you Tyrius. What do you do?"

He blushed but replied with confidence, "I know every piece of tech ever invented, how to use it, and how to fix it." He said proudly.

"Everything?" She asked. "I could probably use a man like you here with us."

Tyrius couldn't hide his interest.

Ryder offered a thought. "Aleria has told me all about her time with you on Arkos."

Suddenly the mood changed. Martha gave a quick glance around then ushered her hand down , "Quiet boy. Just follow me."

He was taken aback and exchanged looks with Aleria who offered a sympathetic expression. They continued into the elevator and Martha hit the top button.

A press of a button on her wrist. Three on the door, and an automatic scan later they were inside her office.

"So why have you come?" Martha asked Aleria. "I imagine you need something. I heard you disappeared. Not a word to anyone. Your parents must think you dead. Do they?"

"I'm not sure." Replied Aleria. "I made sure to cover my tracks when I left. It's a dead trail. The thing is..."

"I know dear. It was the marriage wasn't it?"

Aleria looked down at the ground then back up at Martha, "I wish you'd been there. Maybe you could have talked them out of it."

Martha touched her shoulder. "You made your choice. It will all work out as it should. You have fire in your heart girl. I saw it in you as a child. If this is what you want, to make a life out here away from everything, that is your choice."

Aleria looked around the room at the other two and changed the subject. "Martha, you must show me your home. I remember so much. Show me your paintings. We must catch up."

"Of course girl. There will be plenty of time for all of that. But you've arrived during migration. After the weekend you can come with me to Los City. I'll show you where I spend my quiet time. For now Lucy will show you where you'll stay while you're here. I still have work to do you know."

"Of course." Said Aleria, with a subtle glance at Ryder. "It's great to see you Martha."

Martha spoke into her wrist. "Lucy. Come here now and bring wine."

Angeldown IX

"How long are we staying here?" Tyrius asked Ryder as they sat in the cafeteria of the Martha Group building. 

Ryder shrugged, "it's up to Aleria." He leaned in, "Why didn't Martha want to talk about Arkos? She spent most of her life there. It can't be a secret."

Tyrius shrugged and shoved the burger into his mouth. "She seems nice."

"I don't trust her one bit." Said Ryder. "I want to know what they really do here."

"I've checked the basic setup, total office on the front of it. Limited security. If there's something here it's underneath." Tyrius offered.

Ryder nodded, "Okay. Let's just see how it plays out with Aleria. She was taught by her. And I know enough to know there is more to her in the last two decades than just this space part business."

"Where is Aleria anyway?" Asked Tyrius.

"Lucy gave her the penthouse rest quarters. She's probably taking a proper shower." 

"You gotta get that fixed." Said Tyrius annoyed chomping down on the burger.

"I know." Said Ryder. "I know."

"What's up guys?" Aleria smiled as she approached.

"Where'd you go off to?" Asked Ryder.

"Just had the best shower of my life." 

Tyrius snarled. "An Angeldown with a broken shower is barely even an Angeldown."

"I know right!" Said Aleria in agreement.

"You're the man that can fix anything." Ryder jabbed at Tyrius.

He didn't respond. Finishing his burger he rose to his feet and looked at Aleria, "They have pancakes." He said, "want me to get you some?"

"Sure." Said Aleria with a smile.

Off he went as she took a seat next to Ryder. She bumped shoulders with him. They sat in silence for a moment then Ryder asked her, "Second thoughts?"

"None." She replied.

"Okay. Tomorrow then." He said taking her hand.

Aleria smiled as they watched Tyrius stacking pancakes onto his plate.

"Tomorrow."

Angeldown X

7.49.12 May 02/15X

Medina,

I've found her. I'll keep her here and await your wishes.

Martha.

Angeldown XI

Aleria felt an arm grab her wrist while she slept and she awoke to the face of a man she did not know.

"No! Let me go!" She screamed at the top of her lungs.

"I'm here to take you home." The man replied. "Do you have any idea how long I've been flying around this God forsaken region of hell space looking for you princess."

"Let me go!" She said again, this time with defiance, "Who are you?" She demanded.

Martha entered the room and interrupted, "This is Gage my dear. He handles your parents problems."

They had surprised Aleria in her quarters early morning two days after her arrival. Ryder and Tyrius were peacefully sleeping in their quarters.

"My dear, a lot has changed since you've been gone. Your father is sick. He is going to die. Your mother sent Gage here to get you back to Arkos. It's for the best Aleria."

Aleria looked around confused. "Why like this?" She asked scared.

Martha seemed to get angry and looked at Gage. He grabbed Aleria again, this time quickly applying a brace to her wrist that locked her to him.

"The world is a complicated place my dear. And it only gets more complicated by the day." 

Aleria suddenly thought of Ryder and Tyrius and calmed down slightly. Looking at Gage she asked defiantly. "How do you suppose you are going to get me home? How did you even get here?"

Gage smiled. "I live here." He looked out the large window to the desert landscape, "Well, not here. But, you know, this general kind of area." He said motioning all around him.

"What does that even mean?" Said Aleria shaking her head.

"Don't worry princess. We can get you home. We just have to go visit some friends of ours in Hightower." Said Gage in a trustless voice. 

Martha smiled at Aleria and rose her hand up to her cheek. "You really did turn into a beautiful girl." She said sadly. "Now go." She ordered Gage and he proceeded to drag Aleria out of the Martha Group building and onto his Cruiser.

As its engines began to roar Aleria took the opportunity to reach down to her lower left ankle and activated protocol K. Soon Ryder would find and rescue her. She simply had to wait.

Angeldown XII

Beep, beep, beep.

Ryder woke immediately and checked his wrist. "Fuck!"

He quickly put on his gear and raced to the door of his quarters. He pressed the button but it did nothing. He pressed it again. Nothing. He was locked inside his room. 

"Fuck fuck fuck." He examining his wrist mech. He looked at the door and tried the button again. "Of all the days for her to disappear." He said to himself facing his wrist towards the door panel. It scanned a green laser over it and the display read, "3CLR Lock. Relay overstate push react unlock."

Ryder pressed activate and the door unlocked. It opened to reveal a security guard to the right of the doorway. He turned to the sound of the door but Ryder was much faster, and he soon lay unconscious on the ground. Ryder dragged him into his room and shut the door. 

He raced to Tyrius room. There was no guard in sight, and again he used his wrist mech to unlock the door. Tyrius stood waiting on the other side, "Betrayed again." 

"Yep." Ryder replied. He looked around. It was still early and the hallway was empty. "It should just be building security. Let's see if the ships where we left it. Straight down the left, out those doors, and let's get off this planet. Aleria's gone." 

Tyrius nodded, "Lead the way."

They quickly marched through the building towards the exit, then out the doors into the desert heat. As they left the Martha Group building they heard a loud alarm pierce the desert sky. 

"They're coming." Yelled Tyrius struggling to keep up with Ryder as he trudged through the sand towards the hanger. Ryder turned the corner and saw the Angeldown still parked quietly in the hanger bay. Two armed guards stood at its rear facing the open hanger doors. 

He pulled his weapon and fired both shots of his Glory ZX double shot pistol at the men. The first was struck in the head. The second took the shot to the shoulder and strafed away, firing back at Ryder as he hit the ground. Ryder stopped and dropped to one knee narrowly avoiding the laser bullets sent his way as he waited for his ZX to reload.

Tyrius drew closer to the Angeldown fast with each step stomping hard as his huge frame barrelled towards the guard. He pulled out what looked like a small metal tube from his chest plate. He pressed the button at his thumb and a translucent blue shield spanned out to protect him as the soldier fired multiple shots. He leaped into the air and pulled his hunting knife from his ankle and pressed the war button. He faced it towards the man as a red spear of burning energy extended out from the knifes handle.  It dug and burnt through the chest of the man as Tyrius slammed down on him, his shield taking the man's last shot.

"I see dozens more Ryder!" He cried out, as a small army poured out of the Martha Group building.

Ryder pressed his wrist and the Angeldown lit up. The ramp eased down and both men jumped on board. The alarm was wailing out into the sky as the first of the soldiers reached the hanger. They began firing at the ship as the ramp closed and Ryder sat down in the captains seat.

"Come on Ryder! We're taking damage." Tyrius cried out as more men arrived and began to fire at the ship.

"All good." He replied. "Let's see if this wing rip is as good as advertised."

The engine roared loudly as the active shields kicked in. "We're good." Said Ryder relieved, "Unless they got a cluster rig we're home free. Let's go get Aleria." Said Ryder as the Angeldown began to lift off.

"That was close!" Tyrius exclaimed. "You got a signal on her?"

Just then a red alert hit the captains screen. 'Missiles incoming.'

"Ryder! That's a fucking cluster! Go, go, go!"

Ryder pulled on the controls and sent the ship vertical, spinning as the Angeldown shot through the sky. The cluster rig was a specially designed surface to air weapon capable of exploding into a ships shield, weakening it enough to disperse millions of tiny explosive ordinance through the shields consistency. If it hit the Angeldown, both the ship and our two heroes would be napalm toast.

"6, 5, 4, 3..." The defence system counted down the time until impact. Ryder dropped decoy ordinance but the two missiles seemed determined for the Angeldown, whipping past them and closing in.

"Fuck the wing rip! Just jump!" Cried Tyrius.

Ryder smiled to himself and reefed the controls hard left then straight down, heading back towards the Martha Group building. The missiles followed but he'd gained a few seconds.

"5, 4, 3..." 

Tyrius closed his eyes and braced.

Ryder set the ship to max thrust and headed straight for the Martha Group building. 

With one last move and a quick prayer from Tyrius, Ryder dropped two dead leads out the tail of the ship and pulled back on the controls as hard as he could. Then he activated the wing rip accelerator. He almost lost control as the Angeldown shot straight up vertically spinning furiously through the sky leaving a dark red trail behind the ship.

The first missile hit one of the dead leads and exploded midair. The second went straight through the window of the Martha Group building causing a huge explosion.

They were safe, and pretty soon were in outer orbit, leaving Los and making way towards Aleria's signal.

In the following hours Martha would incentivize a total of eleven mercenaries and bounty hunters to hunt Ryder and the Angeldown, while he and Tyrius trailed Aleria and Gage towards Hightower.

"You know where they're headed?" Tyrius asked.

"Not yet. But she's alive. We can follow the signal but they are moving fast. Judging by its speed they're in a Cruiser or better."

"Not an Angeldown though right?"

"Right." Said Ryder giving him a quick glance. 

"Don't worry mate. We'll find her." Said Tyrius with a pat on the shoulder.

Ryder took a breath and looked at his wrist mech before forcing a smile and looking back at Tyrius. "Let's go save a princess."

"Cut me some slack." Aleria pleaded.

Gage shrugged. "I haven't said anything. I'm just here to do a job."

"No, I mean, literally. Cut me some slack. My wrist is dying here."

"Oh, yeah, I heard they are pretty bad. Hang on."

Gage took the wrist lock off Aleria as they sat in the Cruiser.

"I'd tell you not to try and escape but I know it's a waste of time. The truth is I wish you'd try. I like your family and all, and they'd probably seek revenge, but God have these last three years been the worst limbo I could imagine."

Aleria felt uneasy and asked, "So if I try and escape you'll kill me?" 

"Obviously." Gage continued, "You know once I heard you were on Octavius Island. So I went there, spent three weeks surveiling every person worth a damn, and when I finally managed to gather some intel, I got to the hotel, and it was just a bunch of AI's playing quantum scrabble. I swear I almost killed myself." Gage put the ships flight into auto pilot and looked at Aleria. "You are more trouble than you're worth."

She chuckled to herself. "I took those AI's for everything they had. The stakes were much bigger before you got there."

Gage looked disheartened.

"You know I could kill you right now right?"

She smiled. "But I'm so funny. How would you entertain yourself if you killed me Gage. I mean, you don't seem very charming. When was the last time you even spoke to a girl."

"I have a wife and five kids." Said Gage.

"Really?" Asked Aleria.

There was a long pause.

"Nah. I have four 'girlfriends' though." He did air quotes when he said girlfriends.

"Sounds about right." She replied. "Tell me why we are heading to Hightower?"

Gage realized she was trying to gain his confidence to get information, but he didn't care.

"Hightower has tech no one knows about. Just like Martha. You think there's only one way to get to Arkos in one lifetime. But I know that may not be true anymore."

Aleria looked concerned but interested.

"So, they can jump that far?"

"Hell no." Said Gage. "That's impossible. But they can cheat the system apparently."

"What does that mean?" She asked.

"If I knew I wouldn't tell you." He said matter of fact. "But your parents want me to take you there. So I'm taking you there."

Aleria scratched her head. "Do you think they'll have a shower that works?"

"Shut up." Replied Gage. "I'll get it fixed in port. It's fine. It's just cold."

Aleria sassed back, "Just because you're cold blooded doesn't mean I should have to suffer."

He examined his arms. "You don't like reptilians?" He asked.

"Only the ones that kidnap me." She retorted.

"Meh. You know we don't care about much, right?"

"Yeah..." Said Aleria cautiously.

"Good." Said Gage rising from his seat and standing over her intimidatingly. "Don't worry. I'm only half." He smiled.

Aleria felt unnerved but Gage did seem to have some humanity. She just didn't yet know how to take him, or how to get out of her current predicament. She needed to get back to Ryder and the stones, and Hightower was getting closer and closer on the ships coordinates.

Angeldown XIV

"Scan complete. You are safe to travel onwards. Enjoy Hightower and all it's offerings. Stay if you'd like. Welcome."

Aleria seemed weirded out. "They seem extra nice, are we going to die?"

"You have trust issues." Said Gage.

I'm going to park next to that red viper just so you think they're spying on you."

"Funny." Said Aleria, "you got jokes."

"In all seriousness, you think they sell pants at the market?" He asked. 

"What?"

"The market. Pants."

"Okay."

"Okay what?"

"Pants and stuff."

"Okay. Get out."

The cruiser had come to a halt.

Aleria took off her vest and Gage quickly reattached the wrist brace.

"The guy we're meeting is a priest. He's waiting for us."

"A priest of what?" Asked Aleria.

"Justice or something." Replied Gage. "I need him to grant me access to the Left Wing. Basically, I'm going to sell you to them."

"What?" Said Aleria stopped dead in her tracks, "Sell me?"

Gage pulled on her wrist. "Come on. I know your parents have their whole thing and all, but these guys live where I live. In the real world."

"What does that mean?"

Gage leaned in and showed Aleria a small key sized object, "Walk and stay silent. You don't want to freeze, trust me."

Aleria was unnerved and simply nodded with distain.

"Now. Said Gage. "Let's find a pair of pants. I'm thinking black cargo, lots of pockets."

They made their way through the markets to the entry way of Hightower. The center of five towers stood tall above them. They were about to be met by one of the greatest men alive. Marcus Auros Dakus. Named after his home planet of Dakus. A place Ryder knew all too well.

He stood casually upon a large podium, observing all the people before meeting eyes with Gage. He slowly began to approach as three men held his back, slowly trailing.

"A rare meeting." He said formally to Gage. 

"Your greatness." Gage smiled. "It is an honor."

Marcus took his attention to Aleria. "This moment" he said pointing at the ground, "is a very interesting moment. Yet somehow I imagine you are blissfully unaware. Hello, my name is Marcus. And you are?"

Aleria paused, then responded formally and politely, "I am Aleria. Princess of Arkos."

Marcus smiled. "Well done." He motioned to the giant tower and simply began walking towards it. "Come." He eventually offered with a gesture of the hand.

Aleria and Gage followed.

Angeldown XV

"They're up ahead but this is going to be difficult." Said Ryder. "I can't track her signal beyond the walls of the city for some reason."

Tyrius looked concerned. "They could be anywhere."

"Let's just land and eat. We'll figure it out." Said Ryder.

"You're a good captain." Replied Tyrius rubbing his stomach. 

They entered the markets that led to five giant towers all connected to each other, arching around the face of the city. The markets were a tent network of trade, drugs and art that lay out front of Hightower. With one of the biggest spaceship carparks in the galaxy. They began their way through until Tyrius saw a food stand with zebra meat on a stick. He left Ryders side and approached the mousey looking alien behind the counter.

"What are you doing?" Said Ryder.

"You said we could eat." Replied Tyrius, exchanging his wrist with the alien who then handed him a stick of zebra meat.

Ryder followed suit and soon they sat on a silver bench overlooking the edge of the markets and entryway to Hightowers fourth tower.

"How are we getting in?" Asked Tyrius, ripping his teeth into the meat.

"I don't know yet. My best guess is she's in the center tower. But that's just a guess."

"That wasn't the question. Are we even allowed in this part of space? What if they tag us?"

"It won't come to that. Just follow my lead. We'll hit tower four. They all connect at the bottom anyway. Then we'll find our way to tower three. Aleria is a princess. And if you are the boss. Tower three right?"

Tyrius nodded, "Tower three."

"Alright. I got tags done anyway just after we left Midearth." Ryder handed Tyrius a false piece of identification. "Miner from Los. Like always."

"Got it." Replied Tyrius as they finished their meal and began to approach the tower entry.

"Passes please."

"We just have these." Replied Ryder to the tower security personnel, handing him their id tags.

"That's fine." Replied the man. He scanned them and after a brief moment looked at Ryder and Tyrius. "Enjoy your stay."

They made their way inside the large open doors into the building. Now they just had to find Aleria.

"Let's get a room and set up shop. This may take a day or two." Said Ryder.

"Roger that." Said Tyrius. "See if you can get one with a view of the city. I've never seen Hightower before."

"We're not here to sight see." Replied Ryder. "We're going to find Aleria, then figure out all the who's and what's of what we're up against here. Saros is looking further and further away by the day."

"Saros out near the belt?" Tyrius questioned.

"It's not important right now." Ryder snapped back. "We need Aleria."

Tyrius gave Ryder a concerned glance. "Okay buddy. Whatever you say."

They purchased a room on level nine of tower four and began unpacking their gear. Ryder turned on the sonic amplifier and gave it Aleria's voice. A moment later it began to scan.

"Anything?" Asked Tyrius.

"Nothing." Replied Ryder. "We aren't close enough or she's not here."

"Or she's not talking." Tyrius stated. "If she's in the city we'll never find her." 

"I swear she's in that tower right there." Ryder pointed out their rooms window at the enormous center tower overlooking the city in front of them.

Tyrius admired it. "There are clearances in each section. You realise our IDs won't get us in there?"

"I'm not a genie." Replied Ryder. "It's level 7 or higher. We have to find another way."

Tyrius and Ryder silently thought a moment. Then Tyrius smiled. "Protocol K right?" He asked Ryder who responded with, "Yeah, so."

"We might not need her voice if we know her footsteps."

"What does that mean?" Ryder looked confused.

Tyrius pressed a button on his wrist mech and a screen appeared. He pressed a bunch more buttons as Ryder looked on.

"Here we go. The signal you've been tracking uses EMF and 7 band quantum formula. Every time she steps there's a reaction caused by the vibration. It's only slight. But if she's locked in a wrist brace, she's keeping time with whoever locked her in it."

"How does that help us find her?" Ryder asked.

Tyrius thought a moment. "You're right I'll keep thinking."

And the two of them sat in their room trying to figure out their next move.

Angeldown XVI

"Your highness." Marcus motioned towards a large glass frame that held a steel sword. They stood in a giant museum fashioned room. "Have a look at this. It's from Earth."

Aleria and Gage approached the glass case.

"It is the sword of an ancient warrior. A knight, that came under attack with his men. Fifty to seven and he killed every one. When it was over a girl arrived on horseback. She asked him if he was okay. He was heard to say, 'not without a breath.' Then he dropped his sword and shield, collected the chains of his dead friends, and left the battlefield."

"What was his name?" Asked Gage.

"That's the interesting thing." Marcus replied, "No one knew. The act was witnessed by local farmers and the sword became legend. They watched him tear through the lot, then he simply continued on his way. Much later we had a look. His name was Jonathon Marsh. He killed thirty-seven of them. Unbelievable. Died age 61, killed by a bear." Marcus clapped twice. "Okay. What else? Ah, yes. We should talk business." He smiled at Aleria. "What do you think you are doing here?" He asked her.

"I was hoping you'd tell me." She said with as much confidence as she could muster.

"I've got it!" Cried out Ryder. 

"I was minding my own business until Gage here came along." Aleria continued.

"You know a Gage?" Asked Tyrius hunched intently next to Ryders wrist mech.

"No. But it must be his Cruiser."

"You mean my Cruiser." Said Tyrius.

"One thing at a time." Said Ryder. "She's two below the top floor. Guess where?"

"Tower three." Said Tyrius.

"Tower three." Said Ryder.

Marcus continued to lead them through the museum room until they reached a large black door that resembled something out of a castle. "Through here." He said as he pressed his wrist. The door slowly unseized and began to open. Aleria felt uneasy and looked at Gage. His smile did not make her feel any better.

"Come on. Nothing in here will bite you." Said Marcus.

The three of them made their way through the doors into what looked like some kind of war room.

"I'm going to need a minute." He remarked as he began working on a computer in the center of the room. Gage turned to Aleria. "If this is the last time we speak I'd like you to know, I like your family. You are nice people. I can't be sure you won't die here. But if you do not. I hope you make it home."

Aleria didn't know how to respond.

"Um, thanks, I guess. When am I going to find out what's going on?"

Marcus turned from his computer and gestured a bow. "And it is done." He said boldly. A large screen appeared before them and there were Aleria's parents. The king and queen of Arkos.

Aleria turned to walk away but Marcus yelled with great authority. "Wait!"

Aleria did as he commanded. She stopped and faced him and the screen. "It's a recording." He spoke softly.

Aleria looked at the screen and it began to play. 

"Marcus Auros Dakus, thank you for speaking with us. We'll await your word. If she shows up, we'll have arrangements sent. We trust and have sent a token of our friendship in the form of five billion millennium gold. To your prosperity."

Marcus approached Aleria. "You disappearing is big business. You should not have been so careless to trust Martha. Lucky for you I am not here to do you harm, I simply have an offer to make you."

Aleria considered things, "What's the offer?"

"The red army. You heard of them?"

Aleria nodded, "famous for banding the mercenaries and forming their own Republic."

"That's right. They are large enough now to lean on us. And that isn't good. So far tensions are fine, but we'd rather not have the problem."

"What does this have to do with me?" Asked Aleria.

"Well, that's the beautiful thing. You can solve it completely. In exchange for the stones you have hidden away somewhere, they are willing to create a new border and sign against our direction. We get the Left Wing. And they'll focus on the west and all that mess."

Gage looked confused, "stones?"

"Oh yes, Gage, you are excused. The Left Wing is fine. You earned it." He clapped twice again.

Gage looked at Aleria as if tipping his hat and spoke, "It was nice to meet you." Then he grinned widely and walked out of the room leaving Aleria and Marcus alone.

Ryder and Tyrius were listening intently but they could only hear her voice.

Aleria needed to get the stones to Saros, she couldn't trade them for Hightowers advantage in a war she had nothing to do with. 

"What are my other options?" She asked.

Marcus laughed, "Come on. Help a kingdom out. We'll get rich at the same time, you and me both."

Aleria smiled, "I'm already rich."

Marcus' smile disappeared. "Then do it so you don't die."

Aleria was taken aback. Eventually she offered, "I don't have the stones. They were lost. Stolen by Martha."

Marcus looked confused. "That has to be a lie, does it not?"

Aleria shrugged, "Ask Martha."

Marcus smiled a long pause looking Aleria in the eye. "Okay. Anyway you must be hungry, thirsty. Through that door you'll find a room. Just don't try to leave. This building knows to keep you in. And I really don't need the stress. Ground floor, 7pm. I'll be waiting. There's one more thing we must discuss about you and Arkos. Until then, enjoy the hightower. It's an honor to have you here."

He left out the way he came and left Aleria in the war room looking at the door he'd pointed to. She made her way over and went inside. It had everything she could need. A large bed, a kitchen with plenty of food, and all the amenities. She took the opportunity to shower and it didn't take long before she felt tired. She dragged herself to the bed and fell asleep.

Angeldown XVII

"She's there. Two down from the top." Ryder pointed out the window.

"We still don't know how we're getting into the building." Said Tyrius.

"I have a plan." Replied Ryder grabbing his bag. "Let's head downstairs."

"I'd like to hear this plan first." Tyrius exclaimed.

"I'll tell you on the way." 

They made their way down to the foyer of tower four and found a seat in a diner across from the bridged section connecting towers three and four. It had considerable security. With half a dozen guards standing around it's entrance.

"So through there and into building three? Is that the only layer of security?"

"Yep," said Ryder, "get through there and we're in. Then we just have to hack the elevator."

"Okay. So what's the plan?"

"He pulled out another two ID's. These will get us in. They say we work for Elextrix."

"What broke?"

"The showers on the fifth floor aren't heating. It's where they have their rec hall. Zero security threat. They'll likely still give us an escort. One man should be pretty easy."

"Got it." Said Tyrius rising from his seat and pinning the ID to his vest. "We need to dress for this?" He asked.

"Trade gear. Obvious company uniform."

"Well okay then.""

Ryder took a sip of his drink. "We'll wait until tonight. Guards always get tired an hour after the sun dies. Around seven."

Tyrius nodded. "Seven."

Angeldown XVIII

Aleria looked through the closet and found a nice black dress. It was expensive and had tiny diamonds in it's seams. She put it on. It was 6:10pm. 

Ryder came out of the bathroom to see Tyrius. He was dressed and ready in dark blue overalls and a black company shirt. It was  6:15pm.

At 6:30pm Ryder and Tyrius stood at the entrance to tower three. While Aleria caught the private elevator to the ground floor. She was early and sat in the foyers lounge drinking a bright red drink. 

"Jesus look at these two." Said the first guard. "Dressed for the Gala I see."

"What?" Asked Ryder.

"You can't come in." He laughed, "get lost."

Tyrius looked at Ryder concerned.

"There's showers..." Ryder began.

"Yeah so." The guard interrupted.

"Mate," Tyrius stepped in. "Floor nine I think. Showers leaking and or destroyed."

"Destroyed?" Asked the guard.

"Yeah, you know. Either a ship kamikazes itself into a building, or there's a big explosion and everything catches fire."

"What are you saying?" The guard commanded.

"Here." Tyrius handed him his ID. "We have to fix the showers."

The guard looked annoyed and a little confused, but he scanned the ID Tyrius shoved in front of him and it turned green, so he checked Ryders as well. Then after an awkward moment he offered, "Stay away from the guests. Be a ghost. You look terrible." The guard mentioned.

The two of them made it into tower three. Now they just had to find Aleria.

"Elevator." Said Ryder motioning Tyrius through. They walked through the foyer, as unbeknownst to them, Aleria sat at the bar among a crowd of guests in her black dress.

She noticed them and gave the brightest of smiles. She rose to her feet and drank the last of her drink. Then she walked briskly towards Ryder. He hadn't noticed her. She approached him quickly and touched his shoulder, "Excuse me sir, do you mind if I ride the elevator with you?" 

Ryder looked astonished. "Aleria, wow." He said, "You look.."

She smiled and spun around as the guard who'd let them in looked on.

Ryder looked around as subtlety as he could, then to told Aleria. "This way."

The three walked to the elevator doors.

"It's good to see you Aleria." Said Tyrius.

"You too Tyrius." Aleria glanced around the room, "How are we getting out of here? They won't let me leave and Marcus will be here any minute."

Ryder glanced at the six guards at the front of the building. "I'm not sure yet."

"Well that's great!" Said Tyrius. "Well it was good seeing you Aleria." He said sarcastically.

"Shut up." Said Ryder. "Let me think." 

They stepped into the empty elevator and he pressed the fifth floor. "We have about fifteen minutes before that guard comes looking for us. We need to figure a way of getting you out of here and back to the Angeldown."

The doors opened to the fifth floor and they stepped out into a wide hallway. Large doors led into the recreation hall in front of them and further down the hallway were more doors leading down the building.

"Well, we have her. What do we do now?" Asked Tyrius.

Ryder looked at both of them. "Maybe we can smuggle her out. Let's go fix these showers."

"What?" Asked Aleria. 

He walked into the recreation hall and up to the counter.

"We're here to fix your showers." He said to the girl tending the desk.

She nodded unconcerned, "Okay."

Ryder looked at the others. "Come on."

They looked confused but followed. Aleria felt out of place in her dress and as she passed the girl she smiled awkwardly. "Hi."

They reached the showers and there was no one there. Lockers lined the walls, with each row a bench. He approached a red locker against the wall near the rear wall. 

"You are actually going to fix it?" Tyrius asked.

"Hell no." Replied Ryder. He opened one of the lockers and looked inside. "You'll fit in here won't you?"

"You can't be serious?" Aleria replied.

He smiled. "I'm just kidding." He placed a charge inside the locker and primed it.

"Let's get out of here." He said marching out the way they came.

They each passed the girl at the counter with a nod, "All fixed. You just have to leave it an hour." Ryder told her. 

She nodded back. "Thanks."

They got back in the elevator and Ryder hit level one. "I'll blow the charge when we reach the stairs. Wait for any guards. Most will take the elevators. Then we might be able to sneak through. It'll be a large explosion."

"This is a messy plan." Said Tyrius. 

"Life is messy." Replied Ryder. "Do you trust me?"

Aleria nodded. After a moment Tyrius did the same. They left the elevator on level one and went down into the stairway. As they began their way down Ryder pressed the detonator and the showers blew up. The explosion rattled the entire building.

"How big was that charge?" Asked Tyrius in shock.

"When you get out into the markets, run like hell." Ryder responded.

Just then a guard bustled through the doors but Ryder was there to meet him. He hooked his arm around his throat and held it until he passed out. Tyrius opened the door and looked out into the foyer. "There's one left at the gate."

"Aleria, can you distract him? I just need to get close."

Aleria nodded then walked out the door into the foyer towards the exit to tower three. One lone guard remained and three more were waiting at the elevator doors. Ryder and Tyrius began walking slowly into the foyer, leaving a distance between them and Aleria. She reached the guard. "Excuse me sir, do you know what that big bang was?"

The guard smiled, "It's the revolution."

Aleria put on fake concern. "It could be the red army. Have you checked tower one?"

The guard looked confused. "What does tower one have to do with it?"

Ryder and Tyrius arrived. Ryder walked close to the guard and offered, "Hi, those showers all fixed up. Here's my ID." He approached the guard close as Aleria stepped back. He raised up the ID in his left hand and with his right he revealed a small blade. He dug it into the man's stomach and pushed him back into the security booth. "Run!" He said determined.

Aleria and Tyrius looked on in shock. Then quickly ran out the gates of Hightower and through the outer markets. Ryder quickly followed after leaving the man dead with his throat cut.

The three men at the elevator eventually noticed the dead man and drew the alarm but they had a head start.

They sprinted through the markets to the giant carpark and before long they reached the Angeldown. They could hear alarms going off in the center tower and in the distance there was clear motion out the front of the building as they were lifting off.

Suddenly a fleet of five Vipers charged out the bridge of towers two and three where they housed a giant hanger for their fleet. 

Ryder, Aleria and Tyrius quickly charged up the ship's shields and shot out of Hightower with the Vipers on their tail. They needed to escape the clutches of Marcus Auros Dakus and reach Saros, where they could use the stones, and get Aleria back to Arkos.

Angeldown XIX

"That's the first time I've seen you kill someone." Aleria said unnerved.

"There was no other way to get you out."

Aleria contemplated a moment then responded, "Marcus threatened my life. I could not have trusted him. I'm glad I can trust you Ryder." She said.

Ryder smiled, "Your highness Aleria. My love. I'll die for you."

She forced a smile.

"Now let's get out of here." He said churning up the jump engines.

Tyrius walked in behind them, "We can jump as much as we want until you hear an alert. We don't want anything to do with those Vipers."

"Good." Replied Ryder. He looked at Aleria. "This could get dangerous."

The space ship was in lower orbit cruising around the planet's polarity to gain speed as the five Vipers began formation behind them at a lower speed orbit. It seemed like they were awaiting orders. Ryder jumped and the Angeldown disappeared.

"Where'd you jump to?" Asked Aleria.

"Random outer range." He replied. "Dead space. It'll be harder for them to track. If anything arrives it'll automatically jump. Let's debrief while we can. We might have twenty minutes." He rose from his seat. "Tell me about Gage and Marcus."

"Gage works for Martha and my family, but he sold me to Marcus, who controls Hightower. Gage wanted access to the Left Wing, whatever that is."

"It's a bunch of star systems that separate Hightower and the Republics territories. It's raw land with a few bases here and there for this or that. Totally restricted space. Lots of warlords and a big black market." Said Ryder. He yelled for Tyrius. 

They met in the center of the ship's hull and the three of them discussed Aleria's conversation with Marcus. How he wanted the stones to trade terms with the red army.

"So what's the plan?" Asked Tyrius. "Saros is a long way from Hightower. We need to find somewhere to lay low." He continued.

"I agree." Said Aleria, "Things are getting a little intense. Maybe a soft planet until things quiet down."

Ryder chimed in, "The Left Wing."

"Wait what?" Asked Tyrius, "That's not laying low. That's basically a playground for the red army. That's a bad idea Ryder."

Aleria looked concerned.

Ryder continued, "I still have Gage's tailgate. If we can find him before he reaches the Left Wing, we can still use his ship. It's our best chance at avoiding the next six months travelling deep space."

"The left Wing is the opposite direction." Said Tyrius.

"So they'll have a harder time finding us." Ryder quickly retorted.

They all looked at each other.

"Okay." Said Aleria, "but we don't kill Gage okay."

Ryder nodded, "We just need his ship."

Suddenly an alert sounded. "They're here!" Cried Ryder. "Take your stations."

In the distance a single Viper could be seen approaching fast.

Ryder jumped again. This time in the direction of the Left Wing. The bunch of stars that formed a path to the region of the Red Army Republic. He began traversing the next sector periodically jumping forward random distances and directions. Their travel became a combination of thrusting through deep isolated sections of space and jumping past the more populated areas.

Three days past and they hadn't seen any Vipers. Ryder hoped they were gone for good. He jumped to the final sector of Hightowers region of space, into a small star system with a beautiful green planet. "Gage is here somewhere." Said Ryder heading down towards the planets atmosphere. "His last location is Grimm City."

Aleria opened her eyes and looked at him yawning, "Whoa!" She said faced with the giant green planet in front of her. "What's this place called?" She asked Ryder.  "Planet Gaia III, Grimm City in the Capital Region." Said Ryder, pouring the Angeldown through the atmospheric barrier."

"And Gage is here?"

"Think so." Ryder replied.

"Well let's go find him." She said taking off her Angeldown vest.

Gaia III was a farming planet mostly. Yet it held beautiful landscaped cities with an artistic culture. They landed the Angeldown in the port of Grimm City. The tailgate signal showed the Cruiser near the mountains behind it. The ramp of the Angeldown lowered and they departed the ship in port to the smell of curry. It swept past Tyrium as they walked down the path towards the city entrance.

"That is for me." He said approaching the green alien at the cauldron. "How much for three?"

"Six." Said the alien.

"Did you see that port? There's a Lightwing and a Viper." Said Aleria to Ryder. "But no Cruiser."

"It's near the back of the city. Let's just keep an eye out. We'll get a room setup and recon the signal."

"Okay but let me do the talking when we find him." Said Aleria.

Tyrius arrived balancing three bowls of curry as the three of them stood under the giant archway to Grimm City. 

"Let's go get that Cruiser."

Angeldown XX

Gage threw the nine of clubs down onto the poker table.

"Rabbits!" Cried the alien. His head looked like a buffalo with two horns sticking out. "You win again!" He said in disbelief.

Gage smiled and dragged the money in towards him. "Sorry Tex." He looked around the room. "It's great to be back and all. And now, don't rush me, but I'm going to leave now." He picked up the money and began stuffing his pockets. "Gentleman."

Tex and the two other men pushed back in their seats slightly as Gage rose. "Tell Ruby I'll see her tomorrow."

He began to leave and the buffalo alien rose from his seat. "Hey Gage, you forgot this." He pulled a shotgun out from under the table and pointed it at him. "Now give me the money."

Gage stood with his arms up. "You always imagine this moment yet hope it not arrive. I'll tell you what, if you can beat me in a fist fight, I'll give you the money."

The huge alien laughed and put the shotgun down on the table. He stepped towards Gage. "You're on."

"Fool." Said Gage as he quickly darted for the door. The buffalo alien charged after him as Gage flew out into the carpark. He ran to the boot of his jeep and pulled out a baseball bat as the alien stood just feet away.

"Okay. No problem." Said Tex.

"Come on then." Said Gage.

Tex charged at Gage and he swung the bat. It connected on the jaw flush. He stepped out of the way as the buffalo stumbled towards the ground. Gage adjusted his overcoat and moved around the car. He quickly got in and turned the key as Tex rose back to his feet. "Still in the forest?" He yelled out to Gage. "I'll find you!"

"Not for long." Replied Gage to himself as he drove away from the tavern. He past the train tracks on the east side of Grimm and continued on to the rear of the city. A huge mountain range backed onto Grimm, and Gage's mansion was built halfway up it, edged into the mountains.

"Change lanes! Don't get too close." Said Aleria to Ryder trying to drive.

Tyrius hunched forward in the backseat. "I've never followed anyone in a car before. It's kind of fun." He said, sipping coke out of a fast food cup. They'd been following the signal to Gage's ship. It seemed to be in the mountains behind the city.

They'd stopped by chance at the only tavern between them and his ship. Only to see Gage run out of it and hit a buffalo with a baseball bat. They followed him.

He turned into a gated community called Forest Grimm. A quick exchange with a security guard and his car disappeared through the gates.

"Check the signal. You think he has a private launchpad?" Asked Tyrius.

Ryder was already examining his wrist. They parked adjacent to the gates across the street.

"I think he might live there." Said Aleria looking at the gated complex leading up the mountain.

"Let's find his house." Said Ryder.

He got out of the car. There was a coffee shop on the corner across from the gates into Forest Grimm. "You two go get coffee. I won't be a minute."

Aleria nodded curiously, "Okay."

Ryder went to the rear of the building and into the alleyway behind it. He put out his arm and pressed some buttons and a small metallic ball shot up out of his wrist mech high into the air. It sprouted wings and began to fly towards the mountain. Ryder looked at the screen above his wrist. It showed the drone's view.

"Follow the signal to the Cruiser. Give me ariel survellience. Full compound. Then keep that visual until recall."

The wrist mech's main screen turned green in acknowledgement. Ryder watched as it searched the mountain through the various properties until it came across Gage's Cruiser. It sat parked on a large launchpad next to his giant home. The drone was quiet and could hover there for hours if needed.

Ryder entered the coffee shop. Aleria and Tyrius stood at the counter. He approached and Tyrius handed him his coffee. "Can't have a stakeout without coffee." Said Tyrius.

"I know where he lives. I have eyes on his house and the Cruiser. We'll sneak in when it's dark." Said Ryder taking a sip of coffee.

"Remember, we're not going to hurt him. We just need the Cruiser, right?" Aleria clarified.

Ryder nodded. "That's right."

"Can I play devils advocate?" Said Tyrius in a serious tone. "This Gage guy is connected to Marcus, and works for Martha. We just killed one of his guards and blew up one of her buildings. Shouldn't we kill this man?"

Aleria shook her head. "Not if we don't have to. Let's just get in, get the ship, and get back to the Angeldown."

Tyrius and Ryder nodded, "Yes ma'am."

Angeldown XXI

Tyrius leaned into Aleria and Ryder as they stood along the fenceline of Forest Grimm.

"Does Gage have a deadlock on his Cruiser?" He asked Aleria. "We wouldn't want to accidentally kill him just to find out the Cruiser is a worthless pile of metal."

"How should I know?" She replied.

"I thought you may have tried to kill him." Tyrius stated.

"Didn't get much of a chance. He kept threatening to freeze me with some key thing. Plus, he's a big reptilian."

Tyrius looked at Ryder. "Reptilian." He said cautiously.

"We move as soon as they change guards." Said Ryder. 

Aleria and Tyrius nodded "You still have eyes on?" She asked.

The compound was still being surveyed from above by Ryder's marble drone. He nodded, "The ship hasn't moved."

"What if he's deadlocked it?" She asked.

"Then we rely on your charm, don't we?" He responded.

Aleria grimaced, "I don't like this plan very much."

Tyrius responded, "Don't worry. If he lives out here its unlikely. Only place I know to get a deadlock is in Hyros. I doubt he's ever been past London Town, New Earth."

"It'll be fine." Said Ryder tugging on Aleria's sleeve. "Let's go."

They began trekking up the mountain along the fence line. Tyrius followed behind. They made their way up to the third fence pole. They waited. The guard looked at his watch and then around at the street. Before long another guard appeared and they began talking.

"Now." Said Ryder.

Aleria pulled out two small rectangular devices. She placed them on each side of the pole, neutralizing the electricity flowing through the fence. Ryder threw a rope over, pulling it back to hook onto the top of the wall. "Let's go." 

One by one they climbed the rope, jumping over the edge onto the other side. Aleria turned the fence devices off and looked over at the guards. The new guard sat down in the booth while the other left. "Nothing." She said to Ryder.

"Keep moving. Up this way." He motioned and quietly made his way up the mountain staying off the road as they followed it up. Every now and then a car went past and they would stop and wait and listen and watch. Eventually they reached some trees near Gage's property.

"Here's the plan." Said Ryder. "He has to have security for the bird. You cover me from here while I sneak in the front door and disable everything. It's the easiest way." Ryder looked at Tyrius. "If I need to I can lead him to that window."

Tyrius looked at the building and nodded. The window Ryder referred to showed the back of a couch and a television in his direct sight. "Easy." He said, placing a guitar case on the grass and pulling it open to reveal a rifle and scope.

"Remember what I said." Aleria offered to Ryder. "I'm serious."

Ryder looked at Tyrius then at Aleria, "It's just for backup. Standard procedure."

Aleria looked at the building and bit her lower lip. "I'm coming with you."

"Wait, what?" Asked Ryder.

"You're going to kill him. I can see it in your eyes. I'm coming." She said determined.

Ryder looked at her for a moment then shrugged, "Tell me the plan Aleria."

She paused a moment, surprised. "Um, what you said. We go in the front. You do your little wrist lock hack thing and we turn off the launch security."

Ryder raised his eyebrows and pressed his lips together. "Okay then. Stay behind me."

The pair began to creep towards the house while Tyrius set up his shot. They marched down the forest hill towards the large circular driveway when they heard two gunshots down the mountain. Then after a moment they heard tyres screeching as car headlights lit up the road. Ryder and Aleria hid behind a tree as the car sped into the driveway. 

They watched as two men and one huge buffalo alien named Tex got out of the vehicle and made their way to the front door. They all carried weapons and Tex didn't waste any time. He barrelled his way towards the door headfirst. He charged into it with his two horned forehead and simply went right through. The rest of them followed him inside.

"Who is this guy?" Asked Ryder. "First a baseball bat, now this?" He decided not to wait any longer. "I'm getting a closer look. Wait here." He walked briskly with his pistol drawn towards the front door. When he got to the door Aleria began to follow behind.

Ryder crept towards the destroyed door and looked inside. He could see down the hall but there was nothing. He heard footsteps and nondescript yelling coming from upstairs as he inched closer, pushing what was left of the door further open. He crept down the hallway into the kitchen. He heard more footsteps in the room on the far right. He turned to see the security box attached to the wall on the other side of the kitchen. The footsteps got louder and he quickly hid behind the kitchen bench as a man entered from the right bedroom.

Ryder quietly listened as the man walked through the front of the kitchen. "You find him?" He yelled out to Tex as he headed down the entry hall. Aleria saw him coming and quickly shot back around the front of the house. Hiding in the groove next to a large green pot lined along the front porch. 

Ryder examined the security box. He reefed off it's housing and used his wrist mech to scan it. "Quantum relay encryption red. Utility phase, requires manual override. Cut sectors B and L. Prescript infiltrated." Ryder pulled out a small blade and cut three of the wires. 

"He's here somewhere!" Tex yelled at his men. "Find him!"

Ryder quickly flew down the hall and back out the door to see Aleria's head poking out from behind the green pot. 

"Well we know who to blame it on." She whispered to Ryder with a cheeky smile.

He raised his finger up to his mouth. Aleria nodded, and they crept around the side of the house. He opened the side gate and the two made their way quickly and silently towards the launchpad up the back of the property.

Ryder touched his ear. "Tyrius. Don't leave until you see the Cruiser in the sky."

"Roger that." Replied Tyrius.

They reached the Cruiser parked on the launchpad. "Now this is the tricky part." Said Ryder. "I'm going to need a few minutes." He made his way to the side of the Cruiser and jammed open a panel.

Aleria kept a lookout at the top of the pad staring down onto the property. Ryder had cut the lights to the launchpad so they could work in darkness. She could see the men and Tex glimpsing past each window of the house as they searched for Gage.

"We don't have much time." She whispered to Ryder. "And where is he?" She asked.

"As long as he's not on this ship I don't really care." Said Ryder working diligently on his wrist mech computer. He linked it to the Cruiser and was trying to find a way in.

Aleria watched as one of the men opened the back door of the mansion. Aleria ducked down. He didn't see her. He looked around and up at the launchpad, then went back inside. 

"I don't know how much longer we have Ryder."

There was no response.

"Ryder.. ?" Aleria looked around and Ryder was gone. The panel was still laying open and exposed, hanging out of the ship.

"Where'd he go?" She asked herself. She grabbed her ear. "Tyrius. Where's Ryder?"

Tyrius spoke back through her earpiece, "Why are you asking me?"

"Rabbits!" Said Aleria approaching the ship. "Where the hell..?" She started the sentence as she touched the exposed panel and the Cruiser lit up and the ramp began to descend. She stepped back. "Well that was easy."

Gage moved quickly and before Aleria could react he had the cloth of chloroform over her mouth. "Humans are so easy." She heard him say as she fell out of consciousness.

Angeldown XXII

"And there she was face down in the mud. I've never seen anyone run so fast." Gage was startled by Aleria's scream. "Damn. I've heard of night terrors but you might need a therapist." He said to Aleria as she awoke.

"Um, hey." Said Ryder locked to a railing onboard the Cruiser.

Aleria looked around. "What happened?" She asked.

"Totally natural." Said Gage looking at Aleria then back at Ryder. "Totally natural."

Ryder shook his head. "I've been trying to tell him. The Left Wing is a waste of time."

"What do you know about the Left Wing?" Gage asked him.

"I know you can do far better with us than you can in that God forsaken region."

Gage looked annoyed. "I've waited three years for this. My licence from Hightower lets me do anything I want and I have plans." He looked at Aleria. "I'll drop you off at your ship."

Aleria looked stunned. "Thank you Gage."

"Yeah thanks Gage." Said Ryder with sass.

"Not you." Said Gage. "You're coming with me."

Ryder looked at Aleria. "Rabbits!" He exclaimed.

"Fucking humans." Said Gage returning to the Cruisers controls. "Don't break anything back there." He yelled to Ryder and Aleria as they flew over Grimm City.

Ryder touched his ear. "Tyrius. You there?"

"Loud and clear boss. Saw the Cruiser leave. Dead silence. Thought to myself great. Both dead. So I went back to base, grabbed the gear, and I've been driving around this carpark for twenty minutes trying to find an off ramp. What are you doing?"

"It's your lucky day. You get to fly the Angeldown. Let me know when you're there. Out." Ryder looked at Aleria. "You're not going to leave me are you?"

She didn't know if he was joking or not. "Shut up. Of course not. Gage will help us I know it."

"He only cares about the wild west. We should kill him and take his ship."

"No!" Said Aleria. "Who's in charge here?"

Ryder looked down. "You are."

"Okay. Then just follow my lead."

"Fine." Ryder tugged on his restraints.

Aleria stood up and walked to the cockpit to sit next to Gage.

"I can't believe he didn't tie her up." Said Ryder annoyed.

"I really think you should come with us." Said Aleria.

Gage chuckled, "to Saros?"

Aleria smiled to herself. "No. To Arkos."

Gage looked at her. "I don't think so."

Aleria continued, "Then just get us to Saros. You know we can't get through without this God damn ship."

Gage looked disinterested. "Just go the long way."

Aleria looked frustrated, then after a moment asked him, "What's in the Left Wing?"

Gage paused before responding, "My son."

There was a long silence then Gage continued, "He's with the red army. He's in the Left Wing and I'm going to find him."

"What's your plan for Ryder?" She asked.

Gage smiled. "You really want to know? He blew up the Martha Group building. I only just called off the bounty hunters. He's in a lot of trouble."

"Can't you just let us go. No harm, no foul." She asked.

Gage laughed. "He's literally worth millions. No. You I'll spare though."

Aleria rose to her feet and went to walk away, then turned back to Gage, "What if we help you find your son? He's bound to a mercenary army even Hightower is afraid of, might not hurt to have a few friends and an extra ship helping you out. Get your son back. Get us to Saros. Could be a win win?"

Gage paused briefly then responded, "No. Go say your goodbyes to lover boy. We're almost there."

Aleria unnervingly went back to Ryder. "What do we do?" She asked him.

"I'm not sure. But it's at least two days in any direction to hand me off anywhere. You and Tyrius might have to figure something out. I'll do what I can from here. Let's activate Protocol K."

Aleria kissed him and they both pressed their ankles. The Cruiser began to land near the Angeldown and the ramp started to descend.

"Remember." Said Ryder. "Anywhere in the galaxy."

Aleria pleaded with Gage, "Please, it's just money."

"Yeah millions." Said Gage, "Now off you go. Off." He said ushering her down the ramp of the Cruiser.

"I'll be fine." Said Ryder.

"I'll come back for you." Said Aleria.

"I'll wait for you." He replied.

And she walked off the Cruiser as the ramp rose and the ship departed Gaia III.

She walked slowly back to the Angeldown where Tyrius lay sleeping on one of its wings. Aleria walked up to it and yelled, "Hey!"

Tyrius woke to see Aleria and the Angeldown ramp descending and he breathed a sigh of relief. "I couldn't get in." He said bringing himself to his feet.

Aleria looked serious. "Gage has Ryder. He has a bounty on his head. He's going to turn him in."

Tyrius jumped off the wing. "Where they headed?"

Aleria looked down at her ankle. "Protocol K."

Tyrius smiled. "We have an Angeldown baby! Let's get going!"

Aleria smiled at him, "I have an Angeldown baby."

Tyrius' smile faded away. "But Ryder said.."

"Come on. Let's go." Said Aleria.

Tyrius took a deep breath in, "Sure your highness."

With Aleria behind the controls the Angeldown lifted off and left Gaia III on the trail of Gage and his Cruiser.

Angeldown XXIII

"Is that the gate?" Ryder marvelled at it.

"Third biggest gate this side of space." Replied Gage. 

Ryder's hands were locked in place in the passenger seat of the Cruiser while Gage approached the Left Wing gate's security behind a host of other spaceships. Then from behind them the Angeldown appeared, jumping outside the gates space entry. It moved up behind Gage and added itself to the line of ships. Over the radio Aleria came through the ship's speakers. "Gage please. I'm begging you. We'll help you get your son back. We'll owe you. Please, I'll fucking knight you or something." Aleria was getting angry.

Gage considered a moment then over the speakers came another voice. 

"This is the Left Wing gate. Please state your name and purpose."

Gage responded as the Angeldown slowly pulled away from the Cruiser. Inching back out to space ever so slowly. "My name is Gage Victor. I'm travelling with a passenger for Marcus Auros Dakus. He is a wanted criminal." 

There was a long silence. "And your purpose here sir?"

"Travelling through to Raku. I just sent my licences." Gage seemed excited and looked at Ryder. "You ever been to the Left Wing?"

Ryder shook his head. "I really will help you find your son if you agree to tow our Angeldown down the Tera Straight."

Gage looked at him and considered things. "Oh now I understand. You can't cloak your IDs so you need a Cruiser. Make it look like we captured you. Get you to Saros. Who keeps the Cruiser?" He asked.

"My friend Tyrius was going to 'inherit' it. You weren't supposed to be directly involved." Said Ryder.

"Fair enough." Said Gage looking in his rear view at Aleria in the Angeldown. "Do you think she loves you?" He asked.

Ryder smiled. "Not sure. But I love her."

Gage smiled and looked at him as if considering his offer. Then the voice came back over. "You're good to go through Mr Victor." A sentence he'd waited a long time to hear. He maintained Ryders eyes and smiled as he slowly veered the ship to the right and started flying towards the gate. "Your offer is tempting, but we are going through that gate to Naku. Then I'm going to drop you in a Hightower charge center for processing."

He spoke over the radio to Aleria. "Me and Ryder talked it over and he wants to come with me." Said Gage. "Sorry princess. Good luck getting home. Oh, I'd get out of here too if I was you. These guys can be very suspicious."

Aleria pulled back and flew the Angeldown out of the docking security bay and out into open space. She watched helplessly as the huge gate opened and Gage flew through it.

"It's okay." Said Tyrius. "There was no stopping him."

Aleria slumped down in her seat. "He's gone."

Angeldown XXIV

Aleria and Tyrius went to the closest inhabitable planet they could find. She was unsure what to do and Tyrius had been quiet for a while. She landed the Angeldown in a clearing next to a cluster of farms on a planet called Ribas. It roared to a halt and they departed the ship into the orange sunlight. A man appeared from the closest barn. He raised his arms up against the dust and wind still swirling. Aleria approached him and extended her arms out to greet him with a friendly nod. He seemed reluctant but they shook hands.

"We are travellers. We need directions and we're hoping for a meal." Said Aleria.

He looked at both of them then up at his house. "Is it just you two?" He asked.

Aleria smiled, "Yes sir."

He smiled a wide grin looking up at their ship.

"Sure. Come have a good meal and a good night's rest. Here with Martha and I."

"Martha?" Tyrius questioned.

"Yes, my wife." Said the man. "I'm Harold." He put out his hand and Tyrius shook it.

"You mentioned a meal." Stated Tyrius smiling.

The man smiled and waved his arms all around. "Sure. So much food." He pointed out into the distance, "Look at those prung bulls. Beautiful. I've got one chopped up in the house."

Tyrius looked at Aleria. She casually smiled, "It would be greatly appreciated."

"I'm sure it would. Come now." He began marching towards the house and Aleria and Tyrius followed.

They went inside the big wooden home into a large open living space. There were musical instruments and paintings covering the walls. There were no photographs. The table had boxes of noodles on it. There was no city anywhere close. They had surveyed the area on approach. "Um, do you mind if I use your bathroom?" She asked Harold.

"Sure." He yelled out. "Just don't wake Martha. It's her afternoon nap. Third on the right down the hall."

Aleria looked at Tyrius and rolled her eyes back in the direction of the ship. Then she scurried down the hall to the bathroom. Tyrius was confused. She closed the door of the bathroom and locked it. "Something's wrong here." She said to herself.

Harold arrived back out of the kitchen. "I'll check on the stew. Make yourselves comfortable. It won't take much longer. It's been cooking all day."

Tyrius nodded politely and sat down on a chair in the corner facing the kitchen door and the rest of the living area. After a moment she arrived back out of the bathroom. "Sorry." She said to Tyrius as she sat down next to him.

Tyrius was still confused and whispered, "What's going on?"

Aleria whispered back. "There's no photos of him and his wife, and why would a farmer be eating Taco Noodles from The Steak Fairy three times a week?"

Tyrius realised as Harold walked through the door of the kitchen.

"Guys. Here ya go!" He exclaimed. "An energy drink from Atlas."

"Atlas?" Asked Tyrius.

"It's one click that way." He pointed off-planet into the distance. 

"It didn't show up on radar." Said Aleria.

"They cloak it. It's not the biggest place, but there's a hell of a lot going on." Said Harold. "Me and Martha go all the time."

Tyrius looked at Aleria with relief.

"The stew is almost ready." Said Harold. "Here." He handed them the drinks and retreated back into the kitchen.

"Well I feel a little better." Whispered Tyrius.

"Me too." Said Aleria back, "still, do you want to go there to eat instead?" She asked.

"We're already here and it smells great." Said Tyrius. 

"You think everything smells great." She clammered back. "Fine. We eat, then go. I'm not sleeping near this guy."

"Deal." Said Tyrius.

He charged through the kitchen doors with a glint in his eye. "Martha! Get down here! We have guests!"

He held two bowls. "These are for you." He said peering.

Tyrius rose and took his bowl. As did Aleria.

"Just two more to go. Don't start without us!" He smiled grimly and raced back to the kitchen just as Martha marched down the stairs. "I'm awake!" She yelled.

She saw Aleria and Tyrius and began strolling into the room. "And who do we have here Harold?" She yelled loudly towards the kitchen.

Tyrius rose from his seat at the table. "I'm Tyrius." He offered. "And this is Aleria."

Aleria gave a wave and adjusted her chair.

Martha looked dead tired as she sat at the table. Aleria was about to make up a reason to leave, when Harold burst through the doors with two more bowls of stew. 

"Yummy yummy." Said Martha licking her lips and cracking her knuckles.

"Oh God." Said Aleria under her breath.

"After this I'll bring out the cauldron." Said Harold. Then he started eating.

One by one they began eating the stew. It was a silent five minutes before Tyrius got something caught in his beard. At first he thought it was a piece of bull skin, fallen into the cauldron. But as he pulled it out and looked at it. It had a clump of human hair growing out of it. Tyrius looked around the room at everybody eating and suddenly felt sick. Harold looked at him. "You alright buddy?"

Tyrius felt sick as Aleria took a bite into a large piece of stew meat. He looked around the house, then at Harold. He was eyeing Tyrius expectantly. "Yes?" He looked crazed. "Seems like we got us a judging Harry Martha!" Said Harold staring at Tyrius.

"What is in this stew?" Asked Tyrius.

Aleria heard and looked down at her bowl mixing the meat through the brown liquid.

"Oh God. What is it? Tell me what it is." She said grabbing her stomach.

Harold rose from his seat and so did Tyrius. "Martha run!" Cried Harold.

Martha screamed, "Ahhhhhh." And she ran back up the stairs as fast as she could. Harold ran back into the kitchen as Tyrius reached for his hunting knife.

Aleria was still looking at her bowl. "What do you think it is?" She asked horrified.

"Let's get out of here." Said Tyrius.

"Not so fast!" Harold charged back through the door with a machete covered in blood. "We need that ship!"

Tyrius lunged forward and Harold thought twice due to his size. He looked at Aleria then retreated back into the kitchen yet again.

"You go back to the ship. I'll get this weirdo." Tyrius walked to the kitchen door and covered it while Aleria went past him and out the front door. He slowly crept the kitchen door open to reveal two dead bodies chopped into pieces. There was blood everywhere and a giant cauldron in the center where he'd been cooking them up. He was nowhere to be seen.

Tyrius decided to follow Aleria and get the hell off this planet. He reached the front patio and saw Aleria a hundred yards in the distance marching towards the Angeldown. Suddenly Harold's voice screamed out. "Now Martha now!" As he jumped at Tyrius from the second floor, tackling him to the ground.

Martha stood on the awning of the building on the second floor. She'd climbed out a window with a rocket launcher and aimed it at Aleria marching towards the ship. She fired. It landed just to the right of her and exploded, throwing her off her feet and onto the ground.

"What the actual fuck?" Said Aleria looking back at the house. She pulled her pistol and started shooting back as she ran for cover. Martha reloaded and fired again while Harold fought Tyrius underneath on the patio. The missile shot through the air and missed. Aleria continued running towards the ship. Martha had one more shot before Aleria would reach the Angeldown and she wasn't going to waste it. Aleria opened the ramp to the ship just as Martha got the third rocket loaded. "If I can't have it. Noone can." She aimed carefully.

Tyrius got the upper hand with Harold and managed to cut him across the face. He reared away in agony and Tyrius grabbed his pistol aiming it at the awning above him. He fired five shots as Martha's trigger finger clicked one last time before she fell dead to the ground.

The missile rung through the air towards the Angeldown. Aleria stood at the face of the ramp and all she could do was watch. It sped towards the ship flinging itself around widely and just as quickly as Aleria could close her eyes, the missile flew right over the top of her and the Angeldown. It left nothing but a large tinging sound as it deflected just a scratch off the roof of the ship and crashed about a mile down the field.

Harold struggled under Tyrius' grip. "Let me go!" He cried. "What have you done to my face?"

Aleria came running up to Martha laying dead.

"You want him alive?" Tyrius asked.

Aleria looked at Harold. "Kill him." She said grimly.

Tyrius did as she asked and shot him in the head.

"Now let's get off this fucking planet." Said Aleria.

"That's not very princess like of you." Said Tyrius.

"That fucking guy just fed me human body parts."

They both shuddered.

"Wait." Said Tyrius. "How were they getting to Atlas?" He asked.

The two of them went to the barn where they'd met Harold and sure enough they found a ship. Not just any ship. A beaten down old Cruiser.

"Race you to Atlas." Said Tyrius.

Aleria forced a smile. "To Atlas."

Angeldown XXV

"On this day our brethren celebrate both the absurdity and complexity of life in all its greatness. What a beautiful thing. Kalan, step forward."

Just then gunshots rang out. The kind with metal bullets.

Gage stepped back into the shadows of the alleyway. "They're here." He said to himself as he quickly made way back to the ship.

He lowered the ramp to the Cruiser and walked up to see Ryder struggling with his restraints. He looked at Gage.

"I have a lot of energy." He said tugging at them. "What's all the ruckus out there?"

Gage smiled widely. "Shots fired."

Ryder looked out the back of the ship as Gage headed towards the cockpit. He paused and walked back to Ryder. "This is what having a Cruiser is really about." He undid Ryders restraints and told him, "Sit next to me and watch this."

Ryder considered attacking him but Gage was quite big with tremendous strength, and he eventually thought better of it. "Okay, but no restraints." He said, approaching the cockpit passenger seat.

"Just sit." Siad Gage.

He did as he was told as the Cruiser took off. Then Gage pressed a button and Ryder was quickly secured in restraints again. 

He shook his head and looked at Gage, "No trust."

Staring out the windscreen he watched as Gage swept the ship around the outskirts of the football field where the ceremony had been interrupted by gunfire. People were dispersing in every direction. 

"We're the only bird in the sky for now. But they'll be on their way." Said Gage maneuvering the ship towards the crowd.

Gage hovered above the field as two gunmen hit the Cruisers sights. He scanned their faces, to be followed by a red alert and two beeps. Gage looked disappointed. "No recognition. They are the Red Army though. My intel was right. That's good for us. Let's go." He began to turn the Cruiser around.

"Wait!" Said Ryder. "Look. They came from that fenceline. They planned this thing. Look for a van over there." He said pointing in the distance.

Gage followed Ryder's instructions and glided the ship around the carpark behind the football field. "There's nothing." Said Gage. "If they're smart they go two streets back and have another over by the watershed." He attempted to point with his hands secured.

Gage pushed on the thrusters and flew over. His Cruiser's beaming lights infiltrated every bit of darkness. He flew over an alley behind a local coffee shop and saw a white van crammed into its exit. 

"Told you." Said Ryder pleased with himself.

The Cruiser hovered overhead and Gage turned his sights to infrared. 

"Two male passengers." He spoke determined, "Let's see who they are." 

He fired a single shot into the van. 

"Wait for it." Said Gage.

Straight away the van burnt it's tyres speeding out of the alley and into the street. Gage pursued from behind and before long the Cruiser was hovering above it matching speeds. 

Gage turned to Ryder. "This has to be my favourite gun."

He fired the mini gun and shredded the rear tyres and back of the van. It lost control and crashed into the brick wall of a supermarket. Gage circled them in the Cruiser. Both men were conscious and glared out the window at the ship. The driver's face appeared on the screen in green. He stared up at Gage and the Cruiser while he struggled with the door of the van. "Thomas Bryce." Said Gage, "He knows Will."

Ryder looked excited. "Let me get him."

Gage looked at him.

Ryder pleaded, "I live for this stuff man. I know the problem you got. You gotta fly this. You can't do two things at once. Just drop me on top of him if he's your guy."

Gage thought for a moment then looked at Ryder. "If you run I'll kill you. And I'll still get half."

"Deal." Said Ryder smiling.

Gage halted the movement of the Cruiser as Thomas continued on foot down the street. "Get him for me and if it leads to Will, I'll set you free. Deal?"

Ryder nodded, "Let me out of these things. He's getting away."

Gage obliged and released his restraints, but not before making a point of standing over him.

"Don't worry mate." Ryder smiled. "I live for this. Fly over and I'll jump." He moved to the back of the ship and Gage didn't waste any more time. He pulled out after Thomas who had managed to run two blocks ahead.

Gage flew after him. It didn't take long until he was right on his heels. He brought the Cruiser down to a fast run as the ramp came down for Ryder. Thomas was getting tired. The Cruiser hovered over him and Ryder jumped, tackling him to the ground. "We've got a few questions for you." He said aiming his pistol at Thomas.

Gage landed the Cruiser in the middle of the street and came marching out. He approached Thomas as Ryder held on to him. "We don't have much time. Tell me where Will is stationed and you can go." Said Gage.

"Will?" Questioned Thomas.

"You rode with him last year in New Venice. William Victor."

"Ah, yes sir." He thought a moment. "You're after Will?"

"What does it sound like?" Asked Ryder pointing his gun.

"Okay okay." He cried back. "He's in Black Opal City with the Red Rats. They're a group of mercenaries. You're going to need more than that ship." He explained.

Gage had gotten what he needed. "Get out of here." He ordered and Thomas took his opportunity to continue running. 

Gage looked back at the ship then at Ryder. "If you're going to run, now would be the time." Said Gage.

Ryder looked conflicted at first, then replied, "No. You're my best chance at seeing Aleria again." He began up the ramp of the Cruiser. "Let's go find Will."

"Alright then." Said Gage as they boarded the ship.

They took their seats in the cockpit and Ryder leaned his head back, pulling his cloak over it. "Time to get some real sleep." He said closing his eyes.

Gage started the ship and the two of them departed Naku, on their way to Black Opal City.

"Hey, you mind if I call Aleria." Asked Ryder.

Gage shook his head. "Sure from now on consider yourself my guest." He said sarcastically.

"Cool." Said Ryder as he activated his wrist mech.

Aleria and Tyrius were sipping cocktails in a hotel pool on Atlas. "Ah, Ryder. Hey!" Spoke Aleria into her wrist. "You're alive."

"Of course I'm alive." He said jarringly. "There's been a change of plan. Gage is going to help us in exchange for finding his son."

Aleria brought her hand to a fist and smiled excitedly. "I knew it! I knew he was going to help us! I said it didn't I Ryder."

Ryder rolled his eyes. "Yes Aleria. You said it."

Gage smiled, "Hello Aleria. Turns out Ryder is a useful idiot."

"I know right" She replied. 

Ryder continued, "We're headed to Black Opal City. It's five days from here. We'll find Will, then make our way back."

He looked at Gage who shrugged and tilted his head and pursed his lips as an unknown acknowledgement of Ryder's statement.

"So what do me and Tyrius do?" She asked.

Gage looked at Ryder who replied, "Well you can't get through the gate. So nothing, I guess."

Aleria smiled. "Gotcha."

She hung up the call and looked at Tyrius. "What do we have to do?" He asked looking around the resort.

Aleria smiled and laughed. "Nothing Tyrius. We're doing nothing. This. This right here. This is what we're doing."

Tyrius looked around and back at Aleria as she smiled and said, "For the next FIVE DAYS."

He fist pumped the water. "Yes!"
