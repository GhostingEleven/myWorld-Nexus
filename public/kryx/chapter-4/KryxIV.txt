KRYX IV â€” Kryx First Day

"What's he like?" She asked.

"I only met him once." He replied.

"What's he going to do?"

"Not quite sure yet. Heard he wants to see the book."

She sighed, "Oh no, this is how it always starts. I wonder what messed up thing awaits. Why can't anything just be normal."

"I know right." Replied the man, "he seemed really casual though. Quite charming actually. He said my tie was really nice."

The man seemed to perk up and smiled.

"You're tie is horrible."

"Yeah but you say that everyday and I don't care anymore."

They were interrupted by a knock on the door.

Kryx walked in with an attractive assistant from the museums entry.

"Sir, Kryx is here."

The man quickly took a few steps forward and reached out his hand.

"Jack Miller." He said confidently, "and this is Judy Williams, museum treasurer."

Kryx acknowledged Judy and looked at Jack. "I know your name already Jack. We spoke yesterday."

The man chuckled, "Of course, so you're here to see the book."

"Yes, I heard it's very beautiful."

There was a long silence then the man spoke back, "Yes. Beautiful."

It was followed by more silence, then Jack spoke a question.

"Could I venture? Is there anything specific you're looking for? It's just, these things you know, tend to sometimes, snowball."

"Don't worry about it. That's a superman thing." He replied, "I just want to see it."

The man nodded and the four of them made their way through the museum and down to the underground chamber beneath it. The man reached a large vault and began turning the lock.

"Have you seen the book?" Kryx asked Judy.

She shook her head and looked far off into the distance.

"No, they dont let me see it." She said softly.

"I'm sure it's not that great." He replied before awkwardly stepping up to meet Jack.

"Hey Jack. How come Judy can't see the book?" He asked.

The man looked confused, "It's just not allowed." He replied.

Kryx shrugged and waited as the vault door drew open. The two men stepped inside as Judy and the assistant stood a few feet away. Jack retrieved a large safety deposit box and from it revealed a small case. "This is it." He said to Kryx pulling it open. "I'll give you some time alone." He said with a nod and Kryx stepped to the book and picked it up. "We'll be right outside."

The book was found on a distant planet a millenia ago and had ended up on Earth in the middle of the last century. It contained a variety of stories and myths that noone had been able to interpret. Kryx looked through the symbols and examined each page. It wasn't in a language he understood but he knew what he was looking for. The gold yellow edges reminded him of sunlight at dusk, and then he turned to the page he'd been looking for. "Got it." He said out loud. Then he turned and began to leave with the book.

"Ah sir, you cannot take the book with you." Jack spoke forward.

"Why not?" Kryx asked.

Jack again looked confused. "Because it's not allowed."

Kryx looked at him a moment.

"This book may be the most important thing in the world right now and it's of dire importance that I take it with me for the sake of humanity and everything in it."

Jack stepped back. "What did you find?" He asked scared.

Kryx looked at all three of them.

"I cannot tell you." He spoke loudly.

"What do you mean?" Asked Judy. "Why not?"

Kryx put his fist to his chest and looked into the distance.

"It's not allowed." He spoke boldly and began to leave the museum.

Jack, Judy and the assistant kept quick pace with Kryx as he marched up the stairs to the museum ground floor.

"Kryx, we need to know whats in the book." The assistant asked in desperation. "Why aren't you more concerned? You say the fate of all humanity?"

Kryx stopped a moment and considered things.

"Okay. Here's the deal."

The three stood around him carefully listening as Kryx began to explain, "I knew this book was here because it's a famous book where I come from. So when I came here, this was the first place I came."

There was a very long silence then Kryx corrected himself, "Well, second."

An awkward moment later Judy interjected, "So are we in danger?"

"I just really want it." Kryx confessed, "So I'm probably just going to take it. If that's alright?" He asked the question hesitantly and noone knew how to handle the moment. After a moment Jack raised one arm up, "It's just,"

Kryx laughed, "I swear, I'll owe you. What's this thing worth?"

Jack looked at Judy, "Um, it's a complete, intact book from another planet. It's priceless of course."

Kryx considered a moment, "how about this? You let me borrow the book so I can read it properly, and then I'll tell you everything that's in it."

The man's eyes lit up.

"You can read it!?" He asked Kryx, as the three of them bounced with excitement.

Kryx smiled, "Kind of. I'll see you in a few days okay?" He slowly backed away from the museum staff and as soon as the moment was done in his mind he flew out the doors and disappeared. He flew to the roof of the nearest tall building and sat on the edge with the book in his hand.

"I hope this is what I think it is." He spoke out to the quiet still night, then he opened the first page again, and began to decipher it. Once he reached the same page as before, he smiled and looked up in amazement. He closed the book and stood atop the building admiring the lights of the city in his stead. "Pretty good." He spoke up to the sky before performing a bow off the edge and free falling a moment before taking flight. He ended up staying out all night and found some friends that arranged him a place to crash. They were stunned in the morning when he flew out the window after the last sip of coffee late the next morning. He never mentioned he had superpowers.

The book played its part in giving Kryx purpose. And what he did next surprised even himself.
