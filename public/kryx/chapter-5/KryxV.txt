KRYX V â€” Kryx Takes On Everyone

"You don't understand. I should get to keep it. It's more mine than it is anyone else's. Even Superman."

"It's not a question of ownership Mr,"

"Kryx is fine."

"Kryx. It's just. If you take an ancient book from another planet, well, you just got here, you don't know how things work. People are asking questions. Sometimes things like this, can tend to snowball, you know?"

Kryx sighed, "Look. I'm not sure how all of this works or why you're on my doorstep, but I can assure you, the book is harmless. I've read it twice already, there's nothing in it. You'd have to search for days to find any kind of calamity. I'm not really interested in arguing. Been there, done that. You have no idea how difficult it is to just to manage a simple board meeting in Staros capital. To be honest I have to work out what I'm doing anyway, I have no idea what I'm doing here."

Kryx scratched his head and looked around. "I don't know man."

The man looked perplexed as he looked back at Kryx. "Well, if you say there's nothing in it, do you mind if Superman reads it? Just so we know?"

"You're telling me Superman hasn't read it yet?" Kryx looked confused.

After a moment the man replied, "well yes, he has, it's just."

"He didn't tell you what it was did he?"

"No." The man eventually replied.

Kryx smiled, "He surprises me that guy." After a moment Kryx leaned forward slightly. "I can tell you what it is if you want?"

The man looked around and back at Kryx, leaning in he asked, "what is it?"

Kryx smiled. "The greatest love story ever told."

The mans eyes widened, "really?"

Kryx placed his hand on the man's shoulder and looked him in the eye.

"It was almost perfect." Kryx said, almost to himself.

Then out of the sky came a terrible sound, and the book became the least of Kryx problems.
