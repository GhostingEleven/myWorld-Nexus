KRYX III â€” Kryx Exodus

He had to act quickly or he'd have no chance. He reached for her. "Kira!"

She reached out as far as she could as the platform began to shake. "I'm not letting you go." He told her. She looked determined and leapt towards him in hope. Just as the platform gave way. He grabbed her hand as tightly as he could hold and brought her back from the edge to fall back on the ground. They had survived the collapse of Restos. Kryx, still holding Kira's hand, shot off the ground and began flying away from Restos as it descended into the hollow of the planet. The last ship remained waiting for him and he wasted no time getting them both to the landing bay of their interstellar starcruiser. They stood looking at the decaying planet as it became the beginnings of a black hole.

"What a catastrophe." Kira spoke softly. Kryx thought the same as they both stood watching it slowly disappear as they awaited the jump.

"Staros is enough." He replied, taking her hand again. "Come on. We need to see the captain. He needs to know what we saw."

"Sir. May I speak with you?" Kryx asked.

"Come forward."

"It was an inside job. They have someone in Staros. This is not over, sir."

The captain looked concerned.

"Come with me." He said eventually, marching towards the east wing.

Kryx and Kira followed him into what they thought was his quarters. A few minutes later they arrived at a door. It had no markings on it so they didn't know straight away. A regret Kryx would hold for a very long time. They entered and the door closed fast behind them. The captain stood staring on the other side. Behind them was another door just the same. And it opened just the same, to an airlock. Now it's true Kryx could fly but he wasn't getting through these unmarked doors and he knew it.

They looked at each other. And the very next moment the airlock door opened and only Kryx was left.

He stayed with her in the dead of space alone for a long time. Nothing poetic enough for this kind of story. He didn't know what to do.

After finally letting her body go, he decided where he'd head next.
